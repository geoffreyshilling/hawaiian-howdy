Easily change the "Howdy" message to a Hawaiian greeting based on the time of day and/or day of week.

== Description ==

Set the greeting based on time of day:

* Midnight-10:59 am:  Aloha K&#xe4;kahiaka (Good Morning)
* 11:00am-12:59pm  Aloha Awakea (Good Day)
* 1:00pm-4:59pm  Aloha 'Auinal&#xe4; (Good Afternoon)
* 5:00pm-11:59pm  Aloha Ahiahi (Good Evening)

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.


== Installation ==

1. Upload Hawaiian Howdy files to your server at `/wp-content/plugins/.`
2. After activating Hawaiian Howdy, navigate to the settings page at 'Settings' > 'Hawaiian Howdy' to configure the greetings you would like to display.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

Titles are optional, naturally.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
&gt; Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.
